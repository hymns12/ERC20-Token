# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# ERC20 Token Smart Contract README

This repository contains a smart contract that enables you to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix. Once deployed, you can interact with the token by executing various functions defined within the smart contract.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/erc20-token-smart-contract.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd erc20-token-smart-contract
    ```

3. Install dependencies if necessary.

4. Explore the smart contract code in the `contracts/` directory. You will find the ERC20 token implementation in the `MyToken.sol` file.

## Deployment Using HardHat

To deploy the ERC20 token using HardHat, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have HardHat installed globally or locally in your project:

    ```
    npm install --save-dev hardhat
    ```

2. Configure your HardHat environment in the `hardhat.config.js` file.

3. Run the deployment script:

    ```
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
    ```

4. Follow the instructions provided by HardHat to deploy the contract.

## Deployment Using Remix

To deploy the ERC20 token using Remix, follow these steps:

1. Open the Remix IDE in your browser.

2. Copy the contents of the `MyToken.sol` file and paste it into the Remix editor.

3. Compile the smart contract by selecting the appropriate compiler version.

4. Deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network.

## Interacting with the Token

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with the ERC20 token using various functions provided by the contract, such as transferring tokens, approving token transfers, and querying token balances.

Make sure to connect to the deployed contract instance using an Ethereum wallet or a smart contract interaction tool like HardHat, Truffle, or ethers.js.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the smart contract or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
